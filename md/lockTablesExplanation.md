That line is an SQL command that controls **table access**. Let‚Äôs break it down:

### 1. `LOCK TABLES ...`

* This command explicitly locks one or more tables in the current session.
* While the lock is held, **only your session** can access the table in the specified way.
* Other sessions may be blocked until you `UNLOCK TABLES`.

### 2. `` `Airlines9999` ``

* The backticks mean this is a **table name** (in your case, a table called `Airlines9999`).

### 3. `WRITE`

* The type of lock.
* `WRITE` lock = you can **read and write** to the table, but other sessions are **blocked from reading or writing** until you release the lock.
* Contrast:

  * `READ` lock = your session can read, but not write. Other sessions can also read (but not write).
  * `WRITE` lock = exclusive control ‚Äî nobody else can even read.

### 4. Why it‚Äôs used

* You‚Äôll often see this in SQL dump files (from `mysqldump`).
* Before inserting a lot of rows, the dump tool may lock the table with `WRITE` to:

  * Prevent other clients from modifying it during the restore.
  * Speed up the restore by avoiding concurrency issues.

### 5. Example flow

```sql
LOCK TABLES Airlines9999 WRITE;

INSERT INTO Airlines9999 VALUES (...);
INSERT INTO Airlines9999 VALUES (...);

UNLOCK TABLES;
```

* The lock ensures only this session can change (or even read) the table while the bulk insert happens.
* Then `UNLOCK TABLES;` releases it so others can use it again.

üëâ In short:
`LOCK TABLES Airlines9999 WRITE;` means **‚Äúlock the table `Airlines9999` so only my session can read or write it, until I explicitly unlock it.‚Äù**

Do you want me to also show you the difference between `LOCK TABLES` and transactions (`BEGIN/COMMIT`) ‚Äî since they both seem to ‚Äúlock‚Äù but are used differently?
