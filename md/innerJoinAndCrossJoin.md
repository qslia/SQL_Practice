Great question ‚Äî and an important distinction üëá

### ‚ùå No ‚Äî `INNER JOIN` is **not the same** as `CROSS JOIN`.

They are **different in purpose and behavior**:

| Feature            | `INNER JOIN`                                                                     | `CROSS JOIN`                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Join condition** | Has a condition (`ON` or `WHERE`) that matches rows between tables.              | Has **no** condition ‚Äî combines **every row** from table A with **every row** from table B. |
| **Result size**    | Only includes rows that satisfy the join condition.                              | Returns all possible combinations (Cartesian product).                                      |
| **Typical use**    | Used to relate tables via keys (e.g., `employee.department_id = department.id`). | Used rarely, for generating combinations or when you really want all pairs.                 |
| **Performance**    | Usually smaller and faster (filtered results).                                   | Can explode in size ‚Äî number of rows = rows(A) √ó rows(B).                                   |

### üß† Example

#### Table A

| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice |
| 2  | Bob   |

#### Table B

| id | color |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Red   |
| 2  | Blue  |

---

#### üü¢ INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
INNER JOIN B
ON A.id = B.id;
```

‚úÖ Result:

| id | name  | id | color |
| -- | ----- | -- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice | 1  | Red   |
| 2  | Bob   | 2  | Blue  |

‚Üí Only matched rows (id = id).

---

#### üî¥ CROSS JOIN

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
CROSS JOIN B;
```

üß® Result (Cartesian product):

| A.id | name  | B.id | color |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1    | Alice | 1    | Red   |
| 1    | Alice | 2    | Blue  |
| 2    | Bob   | 1    | Red   |
| 2    | Bob   | 2    | Blue  |

‚Üí Every possible pair (2 √ó 2 = 4 rows).

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* `INNER JOIN` ‚Üí Filters rows that meet a condition
* `CROSS JOIN` ‚Üí All possible combinations, no filtering

Would you like me to show how `INNER JOIN` and `CROSS JOIN` behave differently in your **Cinema seats problem** example?
