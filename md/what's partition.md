### `PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp`

This clause appears inside the `OVER(...)` when you use a window function (like `LAG`, `LEAD`, `ROW_NUMBER`, etc.).

It tells SQL **how to break up the data and in what order to process rows**.

---

### `PARTITION BY`

* Think of it like **"GROUP BY, but for window functions"**.
* It divides the result set into **subgroups** (partitions).
* Each partition is handled independently by the window function.
* In your query, `PARTITION BY user_id` means:
  ‚Üí "Treat each user‚Äôs rows separately."

So user 2‚Äôs confirmations are analyzed independently of user 3‚Äôs confirmations.

---

### `ORDER BY`

* Inside `OVER(...)`, the `ORDER BY` doesn‚Äôt sort the entire output ‚Äî instead, it defines the **sequence of rows within each partition**.
* Window functions like `LAG` and `LEAD` use this order to figure out what is the "previous" or "next" row.

In your query, `ORDER BY time_stamp` means:
‚Üí "Within each user‚Äôs rows, order them by the timestamp."

### Together

`PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp` means:

1. First, split the table into **one chunk per user_id**.
2. Inside each chunk, arrange rows by time.
3. Apply the window function (like `LAG`) within that ordered chunk.

### Mini-example

Confirmations table:

| user_id | time_stamp          |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:37:45 |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 |
| 2       | 2021-01-23 00:00:00 |

After `LAG(time_stamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp)`:

| user_id | time_stamp          | prev_ts             |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | NULL                |
| 2       | 2021-01-23 00:00:00 | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | NULL                |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:37:45 | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 |

üëâ So **partition = subgroup of rows (like per user)**,
and **order = sequence of rows inside that subgroup**.

Would you like me to also explain how `PARTITION BY` is different from a normal `GROUP BY`?
