Good question 👍

In a regular expression (like the one in your MySQL query):

```sql
'^[A-Za-z0-9_]+@[A-Za-z]+\\.com$'
```

the **`+`** symbol is called a **quantifier**.

---

### 🧩 Meaning of `+`

`+` means:

> “**one or more** of the previous character or character class.”

So it tells the regex engine:

> “The thing just before me must appear at least once — and it can appear many times.”

### 📘 Examples

| Pattern         | Meaning                                     | Matches                       | Doesn’t match       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` | one or more letters, digits, or underscores | `alice`, `bob123`, `john_doe` | `""` (empty string) |
| `[A-Za-z]+`     | one or more letters                         | `example`, `domain`           | `123`, `_abc`       |
| `\d+`           | one or more digits                          | `5`, `12345`, `007`           | `abc`, `` (empty)   |

### 🧠 In your query:

```sql
email REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9_]+@[A-Za-z]+\\.com$'
```

* `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` → at least one letter, number, or underscore before the `@`.
* `@` → the literal `@` symbol.
* `[A-Za-z]+` → at least one letter for the domain name.
* `\\.com` → ends with `.com`.
* `^` and `$` → mean the pattern must match the **entire string** (start to end).

---

✅ **Example Matches**

* `alice@example.com`
* `david@domain.com`

❌ **Does NOT Match**

* `@domain.com` (nothing before @)
* `bob@123.com` (numbers not allowed in domain)
* `tom@domain.org` (doesn’t end in .com)

---

### 🧩 Summary:

| Symbol  | Meaning                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `+`     | One or more of the previous thing |
| `*`     | Zero or more                      |
| `?`     | Zero or one                       |
| `{n}`   | Exactly n times                   |
| `{n,}`  | n or more times                   |
| `{n,m}` | Between n and m times             |

So `+` is basically saying — “**must exist and can repeat**.”
