Excellent question 👍

`GROUP_CONCAT()` is a **MySQL aggregate function** that combines (or *concatenates*) values from **multiple rows** into a **single string**, within each group created by `GROUP BY`.

---

### 🧩 **Basic Syntax**

```sql
GROUP_CONCAT(expression [ORDER BY expr] [SEPARATOR 'separator'])
```

---

### 🧠 **What It Does**

Think of it like:

> “Take all the rows in a group and join their values together into one line.”

It’s similar to how `SUM()` adds numbers — but instead of summing numbers, it **joins strings**.

---

### 📘 **Example 1: Simple usage**

Suppose you have a table:

| department | employee |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Sales      | Alice    |
| Sales      | Bob      |
| HR         | Carol    |
| HR         | David    |

Then run:

```sql
SELECT 
  department, 
  GROUP_CONCAT(employee) AS employees
FROM 
  staff
GROUP BY 
  department;
```

✅ **Result:**

| department | employees   |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Sales      | Alice,Bob   |
| HR         | Carol,David |

---

### 📗 **Example 2: Add separator and sorting**

You can customize it:

```sql
SELECT 
  department, 
  GROUP_CONCAT(employee ORDER BY employee ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS employees
FROM 
  staff
GROUP BY 
  department;
```

✅ **Result:**

| department | employees    |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Sales      | Alice, Bob   |
| HR         | Carol, David |

---

### ⚙️ **Common Options**

| Option      | Meaning                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ORDER BY`  | Sort values inside the group (alphabetically, numerically, etc.)       |
| `SEPARATOR` | Custom delimiter (default is comma `,`)                                |
| `DISTINCT`  | Remove duplicates before joining (e.g., `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT city)`) |

---

### 💡 **In your question:**

```sql
GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ')
```

means:

> “For each state, take all its cities, sort them alphabetically, and join them into one comma-separated string.”

Example:
`Los Angeles`, `San Diego`, `San Francisco` →
➡️ `"Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco"`

---

So in short:
🔹 `GROUP_CONCAT()` = *“string version of SUM()”* — it combines multiple text values into one, optionally ordered and separated how you want.
