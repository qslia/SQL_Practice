Great question üôÇ Let‚Äôs break it down:

### `LAG()`

* `LAG(column, offset)` is a **window function** in SQL.
* It looks at the **previous row‚Äôs value** within the same partition (group), based on the order you specify.
* Default `offset` is `1`, meaning "one row before".

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  time_stamp,
  LAG(time_stamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp) AS prev_ts
FROM Confirmations;
```

---

### `OVER (...)`

* The `OVER` clause tells SQL **how to apply the window function**.
* It defines the "window" of rows to look at.

Here:

```sql
OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp)
```

means:

* **`PARTITION BY user_id`** ‚Üí reset the window for each user (so comparisons are only within the same user‚Äôs rows).
* **`ORDER BY time_stamp`** ‚Üí order the rows by time, so `LAG` knows which is the "previous" one.

---

### What happens here

For each confirmation row, SQL will attach an extra column `prev_ts`:

* If it's the **first row** for that user (earliest timestamp), `prev_ts` = NULL.
* Otherwise, `prev_ts` = the previous timestamp for the same user.

So, if user 3 has confirmations at `03:30:46` and `03:37:45`, the second row will show `prev_ts = 03:30:46`.
This allows us to calculate the time difference between the two requests.

---

‚úÖ That‚Äôs why we used:

```sql
WHERE prev_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND time_stamp <= prev_ts + INTERVAL 24 HOUR;
```

to check if the gap between the current and previous request is ‚â§ 24 hours.

---

Would you like me to **draw a sample table** showing the before/after effect of applying `LAG()` to your Confirmations example?

Excellent follow-up üôå

In SQL, the keyword **`OVER`** is used together with **window functions** (also called *analytic functions*) like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

---

### üß© Syntax

```sql
function_name() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column_name]
    [ORDER BY column_name]
)
```

The **`OVER`** clause defines **how** the window function operates ‚Äî which rows it can "see" and use to calculate its result.

---

### üß† Example: Using `RANK() OVER`

Let‚Äôs say we have this table:

| team_name | points |
| --------- | ------ |
| A         | 20     |
| B         | 18     |
| C         | 20     |

Now, run:

```sql
SELECT 
  team_name,
  points,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC) AS position
FROM Teams;
```

**What happens:**

* The `OVER` clause tells MySQL to order rows by `points DESC` (highest first).
* The `RANK()` function then assigns a rank **within that ordered set**.

‚úÖ **Result:**

| team_name | points | position |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| A         | 20     | 1        |
| C         | 20     | 1        |
| B         | 18     | 3        |

Here:

* Both A and C have 20 points ‚Üí same rank (1)
* The next team (B) gets rank 3 (since two teams are ahead).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example with `PARTITION BY`

If you add a **`PARTITION BY`**, it resets the ranking for each group.

```sql
SELECT 
  department,
  employee,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM Employees;
```

Here:

* Each department gets its **own** ranking (ranking restarts at 1 per department).

---

### üí° In your football query

```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)
```

means:

> ‚ÄúRank all teams based on points, highest first.
> If teams have equal points, give them the same rank.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ **So in short:**

* `RANK()` ‚Üí gives a rank number.
* `OVER()` ‚Üí defines **how** to rank (ordering and grouping).
* It‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúDo this ranking within the window defined by `OVER`.‚Äù
