Great question ðŸ™‚ Letâ€™s break it down:

### `LAG()`

* `LAG(column, offset)` is a **window function** in SQL.
* It looks at the **previous rowâ€™s value** within the same partition (group), based on the order you specify.
* Default `offset` is `1`, meaning "one row before".

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  time_stamp,
  LAG(time_stamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp) AS prev_ts
FROM Confirmations;
```

---

### `OVER (...)`

* The `OVER` clause tells SQL **how to apply the window function**.
* It defines the "window" of rows to look at.

Here:

```sql
OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY time_stamp)
```

means:

* **`PARTITION BY user_id`** â†’ reset the window for each user (so comparisons are only within the same userâ€™s rows).
* **`ORDER BY time_stamp`** â†’ order the rows by time, so `LAG` knows which is the "previous" one.

---

### What happens here

For each confirmation row, SQL will attach an extra column `prev_ts`:

* If it's the **first row** for that user (earliest timestamp), `prev_ts` = NULL.
* Otherwise, `prev_ts` = the previous timestamp for the same user.

So, if user 3 has confirmations at `03:30:46` and `03:37:45`, the second row will show `prev_ts = 03:30:46`.
This allows us to calculate the time difference between the two requests.

---

âœ… Thatâ€™s why we used:

```sql
WHERE prev_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND time_stamp <= prev_ts + INTERVAL 24 HOUR;
```

to check if the gap between the current and previous request is â‰¤ 24 hours.

Would you like me to **draw a sample table** showing the before/after effect of applying `LAG()` to your Confirmations example?
