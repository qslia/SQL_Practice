Great question 👍

Let’s break down what this MySQL regular expression does:

```sql
REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)'
```

It’s used to **find names containing exactly three consecutive digits**, not part of a longer digit run.

### 🧩 Let’s explain each piece:

| Part       | Meaning                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `(^        | [^0-9])`                                                         | **Before** the 3 digits, there must be either the **start of the string (`^`)** or a **non-digit character (`[^0-9]`)**. <br> This ensures the 3 digits are **not preceded by another digit**. |
| `[0-9]{3}` | Exactly **three digits in a row**. <br> (`{3}` = repeat 3 times) |                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `([^0-9]   | $)`                                                              | **After** the 3 digits, there must be either a **non-digit character (`[^0-9]`)** or the **end of the string (`$`)**. <br> This ensures the 3 digits are **not followed by another digit**.    |

---

### 🧠 Putting it all together

The full pattern ensures:

> There are **exactly three digits together**, not part of a longer sequence like 4, 5, or more digits.

So for example:

| Name                 | Match? | Why                                          |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ABC123XYZ`          | ✅      | “123” has 3 digits, surrounded by letters    |
| `789Product`         | ✅      | “789” is 3 digits at start, followed by text |
| `Item003Description` | ✅      | “003” is 3 digits, surrounded by text        |
| `Product56789`       | ❌      | “56789” is 5 digits (too many)               |
| `A12B34C`            | ❌      | Only 2-digit runs                            |
| `Product12X34`       | ❌      | Only 2-digit runs                            |

### 🔍 Optional POSIX-safe version

Some MySQL versions prefer POSIX character classes for clarity:

```sql
REGEXP '(^|[^[:digit:]])[[:digit:]]{3}([^[:digit:]]|$)'
```

This does exactly the same thing.

---

✅ **In short:**
`(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)`
→ matches **exactly three consecutive digits** that are **not part of a longer number**.

<br><br><br><br>

Fantastic question 👏 — and this is exactly where many people get confused.
Let’s unpack **why `OR` (`|`)** is used in this regex:

```regex
(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)
```

We use **`OR`** (`|`) because there are **two valid possibilities** for what can appear *before* and *after* the 3-digit sequence.

---

## 🧠 Let’s look at both sides separately

### 1️⃣ The **left side** of the digits: `(^|[^0-9])`

We want to allow two different situations:

* Either the digits are **at the very start of the string** (`^`)
* Or they are **after a non-digit character** (`[^0-9]`)

Hence:

```
(^|[^0-9])
```

means
➡️ “Start of string **OR** a non-digit character.”

If we didn’t use `|`, the regex could only match one of those conditions, not both.

**Examples of why we need both:**

| Text     | Match? | Explanation                                   |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `123ABC` | ✅      | Digits are at the very start → matches `^`    |
| `A123B`  | ✅      | Digits come after a letter → matches `[^0-9]` |
| `9123`   | ❌      | Digits come after another digit → not allowed |

So the `|` allows flexibility — either it’s at the start **or** preceded by a non-digit.

---

### 2️⃣ The **right side** of the digits: `([^0-9]|$)`

Same logic — we want to allow:

* Either a **non-digit character** after the digits (`[^0-9]`),
* Or the **end of the string** (`$`).

So:

```
([^0-9]|$)
```

means
➡️ “A non-digit **OR** the end of the string.”

**Examples:**

| Text         | Match? | Explanation                                    |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ABC123XYZ`  | ✅      | 3 digits followed by letter → matches `[^0-9]` |
| `Product789` | ✅      | 3 digits at end → matches `$`                  |
| `1234X`      | ❌      | 4 digits → not exactly 3                       |

---

### 🧩 Without the ORs, the regex would fail in many valid cases

If we removed the OR:

* Without `(^|...)`, digits at the start wouldn’t match.
* Without `(...|$)`, digits at the end wouldn’t match.

---

### 💬 Simple analogy:

Think of it like saying:

> “The 3 digits must be either at the start **or** after a non-digit,
> and either at the end **or** before a non-digit.”

The `|` (“or”) is what allows both situations to be valid.

---

✅ **Summary:**

| Part | Meaning | Why use `|` |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `(^|[^0-9])` | Start of string **or** non-digit before digits | To match both start and middle cases |
| `[0-9]{3}` | Exactly three digits | The main target |
| `([^0-9]|$)` | Non-digit **or** end of string after digits | To match both middle and end cases |

So the **`OR` (`|`)** is essential because it lets your regex handle **both boundary possibilities** — beginning vs. middle, and middle vs. end — ensuring it correctly finds “exactly 3 digits in a row” anywhere in the text.
