Good that you asked — this query can look confusing at first because the **`ON`** clause here doesn’t compare columns between the two tables like usual (`m.col = n.col`). Instead, it just applies conditions on each side of the join. Let’s walk through it step by step.

---

### 1. Two copies of the same table

You wrote:

```sql
FROM Elements m
JOIN Elements n
```

* `m` = one alias (copy) of `Elements`
* `n` = another alias (copy) of `Elements`

So the database conceptually makes all possible pairs of rows between `m` and `n`. (That’s what a join starts with.)

---

### 2. The `ON` condition

```sql
ON m.type = 'Metal'
AND n.type = 'Nonmetal';
```

This condition does **not** compare `m` to `n`. Instead:

* It filters `m` so only rows where `m.type = 'Metal'` survive.
* It filters `n` so only rows where `n.type = 'Nonmetal'` survive.

Result: every Metal element is paired with every Nonmetal element.
That’s why you see a **Cartesian product** between Metals and Nonmetals.

---

### 3. Why it works

* Normally, you’d see something like `ON m.id = n.student_id` to match rows.
* But here, we **don’t need a column match**.
* We just want all pairs (Metal, Nonmetal).

So the join condition is just saying “take rows where the left side is Metal and the right side is Nonmetal.”

---

### 4. Example with your data

`m` (metals): Na, Ca, La
`n` (nonmetals): Cl, O, N

After the join, result = all combinations:

```
Na - Cl
Na - O
Na - N
Ca - Cl
Ca - O
Ca - N
La - Cl
La - O
La - N
```

---

✅ So, the way to **understand it** is:

* `m` walks through Metals.
* `n` walks through Nonmetals.
* The `JOIN ... ON` just forces that separation.
* Final output = all Metal × Nonmetal pairs.

---

Would you like me to **rewrite this query using `CROSS JOIN`** instead? It might look cleaner and make the “all pairs” idea more obvious.
