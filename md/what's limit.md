### üîπ What `LIMIT` Does

In **MySQL**, the `LIMIT` clause is used to **restrict the number of rows returned** by a query.

---

### üîπ Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

This means:

> ‚ÄúShow only the first `number` rows of the result.‚Äù

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 3;
```

üëâ returns only the first **3 rows** from the `Orders` table.

---

### üîπ Used with `ORDER BY`

When you combine `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, MySQL first **sorts** the rows, then takes only the top ones.

Example:

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. `GROUP BY customer_number` groups rows by each customer.
2. `COUNT(order_number)` counts how many orders each customer placed.
3. `ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC` sorts customers by order count, from **highest to lowest**.
4. `LIMIT 1` picks only the **first row** ‚Äî the customer who has the **most orders**.

---

### üîπ Optional Offset

You can also skip rows with an **offset**:

```sql
LIMIT offset, count;
```

Example:

```sql
LIMIT 2, 3;
```

üëâ skips the first **2** rows, then returns the next **3**.

So if your sorted result has:

```
Row1
Row2
Row3
Row4
Row5
Row6
```

`LIMIT 2, 3` will return rows **3, 4, 5**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Usage        | Meaning                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `LIMIT 5`    | Return only the first 5 rows        |
| `LIMIT 1`    | Return only the top row             |
| `LIMIT 2, 3` | Skip 2 rows, then return the next 3 |
| `LIMIT 0, 1` | Same as `LIMIT 1`                   |

Would you like me to show how `LIMIT` behaves *without* `ORDER BY` (so you can see the difference)?
