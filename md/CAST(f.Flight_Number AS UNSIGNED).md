Great question!

### Why `CAST(f.Flight_Number AS UNSIGNED)`?

If `Flight_Number` is stored as **text (VARCHAR)**, a plain `ORDER BY f.Flight_Number` sorts **lexicographically**, which gives the wrong order for numbers:

* Lexicographic: `1, 10, 100, 11, 2`
* What you want (numeric): `1, 2, 10, 11, 100`

`CAST(... AS UNSIGNED)` converts the text to a number for sorting, so you get true **numeric order within each airline**.

### How MySQL converts strings to numbers

* Leading digits become the number:
  `CAST('007' AS UNSIGNED) = 7`, `CAST('12B' AS UNSIGNED) = 12`
* If it **doesn’t start** with a digit, result is `0`:
  `CAST('A12' AS UNSIGNED) = 0`

That’s why the `ORDER BY` also includes a **string fallback**:

```sql
ORDER BY ac.Airline,
         CAST(f.Flight_Number AS UNSIGNED),
         f.Flight_Number;  -- tie-breaker for same numeric part (e.g., '7' vs '7A')
```

### When you DON’T need it

* If `Flight_Number` is already an `INT`, just do:

  ```sql
  ORDER BY ac.Airline, f.Flight_Number;
  ```

### Alternatives / edge cases

* Shorthand numeric cast: `ORDER BY ac.Airline, (f.Flight_Number + 0), f.Flight_Number`
* If values may contain letters anywhere and you want to sort by **digits only**, strip non-digits (MySQL 8+):

  ```sql
  ORDER BY ac.Airline,
           CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(f.Flight_Number, '[^0-9]', '') AS UNSIGNED),
           f.Flight_Number;
  ```
* Performance: casting in `ORDER BY` can prevent index use. If this matters, consider a **generated column** with an index:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE flights9999
    ADD COLUMN Flight_Number_N INT
      GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(Flight_Number, '[^0-9]', '') AS UNSIGNED)) STORED,
    ADD INDEX idx_airline_num (Airline, Flight_Number_N);
  ```

  Then order by `Airline, Flight_Number_N`.
