A **`CROSS JOIN`** in SQL is a type of join that produces the **Cartesian product** of two tables.

That means:

* Every row from the first table is paired with **every row** from the second table.
* If table A has `m` rows and table B has `n` rows, then the result of `CROSS JOIN` will have `m √ó n` rows.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SchoolA
CROSS JOIN SchoolB;
```

If `SchoolA` has 2 rows and `SchoolB` has 3 rows, the result will have `2 √ó 3 = 6` rows, with every possible pairing between SchoolA and SchoolB students.

---

### Why we used it in your triplet problem:

You wanted to pick **one student from each school**.
So we need to consider **all possible combinations** of (SchoolA √ó SchoolB √ó SchoolC).
That‚Äôs exactly what `CROSS JOIN` gives us.

After generating all combinations, we then filter with conditions:

* Names must be pairwise distinct.
* IDs must be pairwise distinct.

Would you like me to also show you the **step-by-step output** of the `CROSS JOIN` before filtering, so you can see how the rejected triplets are eliminated?



Great question üôÇ

The **Cartesian product** in mathematics (and in SQL when using `CROSS JOIN`) means:

üëâ Combine **every element of one set** with **every element of another set**.

---

### Simple Example in Math

If you have:

* Set A = {1, 2}
* Set B = {x, y, z}

The **Cartesian product** A √ó B is:

```
(1, x), (1, y), (1, z), 
(2, x), (2, y), (2, z)
```

That‚Äôs **2 √ó 3 = 6 pairs**.

---

### In SQL

If `SchoolA` has:

```
Alice
Bob
```

and `SchoolB` has:

```
Tom
Jerry
```

Then:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SchoolA
CROSS JOIN SchoolB;
```

Results in:

```
(Alice, Tom)
(Alice, Jerry)
(Bob, Tom)
(Bob, Jerry)
```

Every row from `SchoolA` is paired with **every row** from `SchoolB`.

---

### Why important here

When you want **all possible triplets** (SchoolA √ó SchoolB √ó SchoolC), the Cartesian product gives you the full set of combinations.
Then you just filter out the invalid ones (same ID or same name).

---

Would you like me to make a **visual diagram/table** that shows how the Cartesian product expands step by step for your three schools?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî **MySQL absolutely allows `FROM` with two (or more) tables**.

Let‚Äôs go step by step so you fully understand what‚Äôs happening when you write:

```sql
FROM FriendRequest, RequestAccepted;
```

---

### üß© 1. What it actually means

When you list **multiple tables** in a `FROM` clause separated by commas, like:

```sql
FROM table1, table2
```

MySQL interprets it as a **CROSS JOIN** ‚Äî that is, every row from `table1` is paired with **every** row from `table2`.

üëâ So it‚Äôs equivalent to:

```sql
FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2
```

If `table1` has 5 rows and `table2` has 10 rows, the result set will have `5 √ó 10 = 50` rows.

---

### üßÆ 2. Why it‚Äôs okay in your query

In your query, you‚Äôre doing this:

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        IFNULL(
            COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id),
            0
        ),
        2
    ) AS accept_rate
FROM FriendRequest, RequestAccepted;
```

That‚Äôs fine because:

* You‚Äôre **not selecting individual rows** from the combined data.
* You‚Äôre **using aggregate functions** (`COUNT`) over the entire dataset.
* The *cross join effect* doesn‚Äôt change the result ‚Äî since you‚Äôre counting **distinct pairs**, the duplication caused by the cross join doesn‚Äôt matter (MySQL will still correctly count the distinct `(requester_id, accepter_id)` pairs).

‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî this syntax is **valid** and works as intended in this specific case.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. When it‚Äôs *not* recommended

In general, you should **avoid listing multiple tables without a `JOIN` condition** unless:

* You **really** want a cross join, or
* You‚Äôre doing **independent aggregations** (like here).

For example, this can cause an explosion in rows if you try to select columns directly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM FriendRequest, RequestAccepted;  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could return millions of rows!
```

So ‚Äî it‚Äôs valid syntax, but you should use it **only intentionally**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Statement                             | Meaning                        | Allowed in MySQL? |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `FROM table1, table2`                 | Cross join (Cartesian product) | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| `FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON ...`      | Inner join                     | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| `FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON ...` | Left join                      | ‚úÖ Yes             |

‚úîÔ∏è In your case, `FROM FriendRequest, RequestAccepted` is **perfectly fine and valid SQL**.
