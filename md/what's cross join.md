A **`CROSS JOIN`** in SQL is a type of join that produces the **Cartesian product** of two tables.

That means:

* Every row from the first table is paired with **every row** from the second table.
* If table A has `m` rows and table B has `n` rows, then the result of `CROSS JOIN` will have `m Ã— n` rows.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SchoolA
CROSS JOIN SchoolB;
```

If `SchoolA` has 2 rows and `SchoolB` has 3 rows, the result will have `2 Ã— 3 = 6` rows, with every possible pairing between SchoolA and SchoolB students.

### Why we used it in your triplet problem:

You wanted to pick **one student from each school**.
So we need to consider **all possible combinations** of (SchoolA Ã— SchoolB Ã— SchoolC).
Thatâ€™s exactly what `CROSS JOIN` gives us.

After generating all combinations, we then filter with conditions:

* Names must be pairwise distinct.
* IDs must be pairwise distinct.

Would you like me to also show you the **step-by-step output** of the `CROSS JOIN` before filtering, so you can see how the rejected triplets are eliminated?



Great question ðŸ™‚

The **Cartesian product** in mathematics (and in SQL when using `CROSS JOIN`) means:

ðŸ‘‰ Combine **every element of one set** with **every element of another set**.

---

### Simple Example in Math

If you have:

* Set A = {1, 2}
* Set B = {x, y, z}

The **Cartesian product** A Ã— B is:

```
(1, x), (1, y), (1, z), 
(2, x), (2, y), (2, z)
```

Thatâ€™s **2 Ã— 3 = 6 pairs**.

### In SQL

If `SchoolA` has:

```
Alice
Bob
```

and `SchoolB` has:

```
Tom
Jerry
```

Then:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SchoolA
CROSS JOIN SchoolB;
```

Results in:

```
(Alice, Tom)
(Alice, Jerry)
(Bob, Tom)
(Bob, Jerry)
```

Every row from `SchoolA` is paired with **every row** from `SchoolB`.

---

### Why important here

When you want **all possible triplets** (SchoolA Ã— SchoolB Ã— SchoolC), the Cartesian product gives you the full set of combinations.
Then you just filter out the invalid ones (same ID or same name).

---

Would you like me to make a **visual diagram/table** that shows how the Cartesian product expands step by step for your three schools?
