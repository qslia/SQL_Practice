Excellent question 👏

Let’s break down this key part of the SQL query carefully:

```sql
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email
```

This is the **self-join** part of the query — meaning we are joining the **same table (`Person`) with itself**.

---

## 🧩 Step-by-step explanation

### 1️⃣ `FROM Person p1 JOIN Person p2`

Here:

* `p1` and `p2` are **aliases** — they represent **two different views** of the **same table**.
* This lets us compare **rows against other rows** in the same table.

💡 Think of it like making two copies of the same table in memory:

```
p1 → acts as "first copy"
p2 → acts as "second copy"
```

---

### 2️⃣ `ON p1.email = p2.email`

This condition means:

> “Match every row from `p1` with every row from `p2` that has the **same email**.”

So it pairs up all rows that have the same email address.

Example data:

| id | email                                       |
| -- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |
| 2  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)   |
| 3  | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |

When you self-join with `ON p1.email = p2.email`, the result will look like this 👇

| p1.id | p1.email                                    | p2.id | p2.email                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) | 1     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |
| 1     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) | 3     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |
| 3     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) | 1     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |
| 3     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) | 3     | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) |
| 2     | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)   | 2     | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)   |

So every pair of rows that share the same email are now connected.

---

### 3️⃣ Why this is useful

Once we’ve matched all rows with the same email, we can now **compare their IDs** to find duplicates.

In our DELETE query:

```sql
WHERE p1.id > p2.id
```

we keep the smallest ID and remove all others.

For the example above:

* For `john@example.com`, the pairs `(1,3)` and `(3,1)` exist.
  The condition `p1.id > p2.id` is true only when `(3,1)` → so row with `id = 3` is deleted.
* For `bob@example.com`, there’s only one row, so nothing matches.

---

### 🧠 Visualization

You can think of it like:

```
Compare every email in the table against every other email.
If two rows have the same email, delete the one with the higher id.
```

That’s exactly what this join accomplishes.

✅ **Summary:**

| Clause                          | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `FROM Person p1 JOIN Person p2` | Create pairs of rows from the same table            |
| `ON p1.email = p2.email`        | Match rows that share the same email                |
| `WHERE p1.id > p2.id`           | Pick only the duplicates (higher id ones) to delete |

---

So in plain English:

> “Join the table to itself to find all pairs of rows with the same email, and delete the one with the higher id — keeping only the one with the smallest id.”
